Java program to count the occurrences of each character
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count=0;
        String str = "geeksforgeeks";
        String completed = "";
        for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++) {
             count=0; 
            for(int j=i; j<str.length();j++) {
                if(str.charAt(i)==str.charAt(j)) {
                    count++;   
                }
            }
            String s = String.valueOf(str.charAt(i));
            if(!completed.contains(s)){
                completed=completed+str.charAt(i);
                System.out.println("Total number of count of occurance of "+str.charAt(i)+" is "+count);
            }         
        }
 
    }
}

Total number of count of occurance of g is 2
Total number of count of occurance of e is 4
Total number of count of occurance of k is 2
Total number of count of occurance of s is 2
Total number of count of occurance of f is 1
Total number of count of occurance of o is 1
Total number of count of occurance of r is 1
